# Simulation-of-Manual-transmission-with-OpenGL
Automobiles of today are equipped with manual or automatic transmissions. Here I am trying to showcase how power is transmitted from an engine to wheels in an automobile with manual transmission.  Speed and torque of a vehicle is controlled by transmission system of the vehicle. Here in my project we will show the different gear arrangement in a transmission system and also how the power flows from the engine output to output shaft (wheels) on different gears. I demonstrate 4 gear transmission system.  This project demonstrates the power of openGL. Different gear states will be choosed based on user input from the menu so itâ€™s an interactive project employing different features of Computer graphics language standard OpenGL.

The the repository contains the project folder of Code Blocks. Your can either open the project in Code blocks and then run the code or you can compile in terminal using the following.

g++ <filename> -o gl -lGL -lGLU -lglut
